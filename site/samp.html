<h2 style="color:green">Samp is dried corn kernels that have been stamped and chopped until broken but not as fine as Mielie-meal or mielie rice. The coating around the kernel loosens and is removed during the pounding and stamping process. It is used in the Xhosa variant of Umngqusho and sometimes eaten with Chakalaka. It can also be served with beef, lamb, poultry and in stuffings.

According to the American Heritage dictionary (4th edition), "samp" is of Native American origin, coming from the Narragansett word "nasaump." New Englanders since early colonial times have referred to cornmeal mush or cereal as "samp."

Like hominy, samp is prepared from groats (dehulled kernels) of maize, but the two are produced by different processes.

Unbroken and unhusked maize (corn) kernels can also be cooked (boiled) until tender. This food is called stampmielies in Afrikaans.

Samp is often served with beans, as in "samp and beans".</h2>
