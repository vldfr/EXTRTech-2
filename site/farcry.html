<h3 style="color:red"><b>Far Cry 3 is a first-person shooter, which also features role-playing game elements including experience points, skill trees, and a crafting system. The player has the ability to take cover behind objects to break enemies' lines of sight and also to peek around and over cover and blindfire. The player also has the ability to perform silent "takedowns" by performing melee attacks from above, below, or close behind. The game's narrative director, Jason Vandenberghe, said that the story mode map is around ten times larger than in the game's previous installments. Players are given the ability to survey and plan out their attacks with stealth takedown combinations and also tag enemies with the camera in order to track their movement once they break the player's line of sight.[12]
Equipment is controlled by a simple system. As missions are completed, new items are unlocked to be purchased or crafted by Jason, using the pelts of various animals around the island. As radio towers are unlocked, this opens areas of the map and unlocks weapons in the shop for free. As outposts of Vaas' pirate group are attacked and retaken, the vicinity around the outpost becomes safer, it also unlocks new side quests for that area.</b></h3>
